**DESCRIPTION : 

The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a comprehensive, Python-based modular toolkit designed for security professionals and ethical hackers. This toolkit includes multiple modules, such as a Port Scanner and a Brute-Forcer, to facilitate various penetration testing tasks. Each module is designed to be independent yet can be easily integrated into a larger testing framework, allowing users to customize their testing approach based on specific needs.

#KEY FEATURES : 

Modular Architecture: Each tool is encapsulated in its own module, making it easy to add, remove, or modify functionalities without affecting the entire toolkit.

Port Scanner: Quickly identify open ports on a target system, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and services running on those ports.

Brute-Forcer: Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems by systematically trying various username and password combinations. This module supports both dictionary and brute-force attacks.

User -Friendly Interface: Command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction with the toolkit, allowing users to execute tests and view results seamlessly.

Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is provided for each module, including usage instructions, examples, and best practices for ethical penetration testing.

Extensible Framework: Designed to allow developers to easily add new modules or enhance existing ones, promoting community contributions and collaboration.
